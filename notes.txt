    -> need to modify save / load code too.

  2.add "mode:" text next to mode indicator.

  2.bug: selection placement wrong when zoomed in / out.

    http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/elegant-icon-font

    so that it won't go outside of view.
    so it won't overlap with other buttons.

list mode:
  2.consistent item focus outline rendering.
    for images too.
    make sure to move the focus for selection changes.

  2.use only one listener for move drag (and perhaps for rotate and scale too).
    touchpad drag move is choppy -- too few sample points, it seems.
    -> listening to the entire viewport and follow the item might help.

  2.go up to the list page (shift-'u') is too easy.

  2.rotate and scale mode don't work when mouse cursor outside of the item.

  3.drag and drop import of images from file system.

  4.css perspective transform both image and text.

  5.item scale x and y separately.

text item / mode:
  2.css: nowhere but text items are user selectable.
    only in edit mode -- otherwise (shift) click-select in list mode selects
      text.
    but image items can take focus.
    texts in palette are selectable?

  2.copy text (to the os).

  2.ctrl-enter during text input with Japanese IME exits text mode.

    go to the beginning / end of the text.
    go to the beginning / end of line.
    'esc'.
    split into another item.
    drop the 'i' and 'e' list mode keys.

  2.selected stroke indicator.

  2.display image state somewhere (in draw mode too) -- transform and

    4.ink stroke to use timing information for the stroke width.

  3.tool selection icons (same as tool sample) on the right edge with keyboard
      key assignment.

  4.brush pressure.
    wacom pen pressure support?
    https://github.com/ZaneA/WacomWebPlugin

  5.draw with rotate state kept.
    scaling?

image filters:
  4.blend modes.
    no preview -- just compute in js.

  4.blur.

  4.image color correction.

stencil mode:
  2.drop color and alpha selection / adjustment.

  3.make buttons for all actions.

  3.make stencil with scaled / rotated images work.
    or disable, or something...

code clean up:
  2.move logic from editor/List etc to actions.

  2.split files > 100 lines.

  >>[N]2.get rid of the form tag.

  2.render html with template (ejs?) and decorate at runtime.

bug:
  2.'n' / shift-'n' for z control in list mode doesn't seem to be working.

  2.esc from draw mode fails if there is another image with higher (closer) z.

  2.make sure drawing surface coord system is right:
    with viewport xforms
    with item xforms (when editing an image item).
    and write test.

  2.after marge two images, marker doesn't cover the entire new image boundary.

  2.no draw cursor when gone into draw mode.
    -> cursor appears when brush changed.

  3.marker doesn't move if drag item ends with cursor on top of another item.

  3.shift-enter during text input with Japanese IME throws exception.

  3.list mode copy xformed text -> make a copy with xform dropped.
    image copy works fine with xform.

  3. make hsl parameter not go over the limit by mapping to [0, 1].

  >>[N]4.toggle alpha lock in list mode not working.

  >>[N]4.blend alpha control in list mode not working.

  4.stencile mode:
    sometimes -- change brush and immediately drawing.
      stroke's draw is called w/ color member null.

  4.list mode palette -> alpha hex control is not working.

  4.smudge leaves dark area around edge.

  4.drawing with low alpha brush repeatedly doesn't reach alph=1.0.

  4.extension only: saved page doesn't get the background image when loaded.
